This project consisted of using bootstrap grids to create layouts that would be responsive for different screen sizes. Currently it consists of 3 html documents and their associated CSS stylesheets.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap Framework.

UPDATE: 7/28/2020 Upon further effort put into this project I chose to use css styling to achieve responsiveness for multiple screen sizes.
