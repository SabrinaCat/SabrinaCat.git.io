This project consisted of using bootstrap grids to create layouts that would be responsive for different screen sizes. Currently it consists of 3 html documents and their associated CSS stylesheets.
It is a work in progress and updates will consist of finished links to projects.



* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)
